Changes in MOC 0.8
======================


Bugs Fixes:
-----------

Printing of moc objects without pgmu parameters is now working
properly.

The expected function was not assigned internally when returnig
a matrix.

Entropy now works with 0 posterior probabilities.

The observed posterior means were not computed correctly when there
was missing values in the response variable. The values were divided
by the total weighted posterior propabilities instead of the total
over non-missing responses. This is fixed in the moc object and in
the method obsfit.moc.

There where some problems when plotting the residuals with a big
number of groups, there is a new option to resolve this (see New
Features).


New Features:
-------------

The functions gmu,gshape,gextra,expected are now list of functions:
one for each group. It should make coding of groups definition easier.
It uses less memory, so you can run larger models.

There are new options:

   - the option check.length allows to bypass the dimension check of
   the returned value of the functions in gextra. This allows using
   densities with more parameters.
   - plot.moc now has the option scale which tells to plot the scaled
   variables, prob.legend ta add a mixture probablity legend and
   group.colors to specify the group colors.
   - plot.residuals.moc has the option groups to specify for which
   mixture groups the plot is requested.

Entropy is now weighted.

There are some new functions:

   - profilesplot.moc that nicely plot subject profiles with a mix of
   colors.
   - mix.colors.moc computes subjects color by mixing group colors
   according to posterior probabilities. This function is in the file
   Utils.moc.R which is sourced when we load the library. This file
   also contain the functions glogit and inv.glogit.

The file combine.moc.R contains some utility functions to combine moc
models and must be sourced by the user to be available.
