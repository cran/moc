Changes in MOC 0.8-2
======================


Bugs Fixes:
-----------
   
   The "Mean Posterior Mixture Probabilities" reported by print.moc is now
   a weighted mean.

   The documentation for moc.dat does not issue a check warning anymore.
      
   The length of the parameters np1 and np2 of utility function combine.parfun 
   (see Utils/combine.moc.R) can now be longer then 17.

New Features:
-------------

   The functions to create latex tables in the file Sweave/moc_sweave.R now
   also generate the tabular environment.

   The report generation file Sweave/moc.Rnw now include a pair plot of the
   posterior probabilities.


Changes in MOC 0.8-1
======================


Bugs Fixes:
-----------

   The check for mixture probablities summing to 1 was not performed, it is now
   done before and after fitting the model.

   Attributes of the expected function are now preserved.

   Warning "the condition has length > 1" shouldn't appear anymore (I hope):
   the line if (mix == 1) have been changed to if(object$groups==1) in post.moc.



New Features:
-------------

   AIC( ,k="BIC") also output -2*logLik.

   Scale option in plot.moc now uses weighted mean and standard deviation.

   Parameters np1 and np2 of utility function combine.parfun (see Utils/combine.moc.R)
   now expect parameter indexes insted of numbers of parameters.

   Author and e-mail can be set in Sweave (see Sweave/moc.Rnw).




Changes in MOC 0.8
======================


Bugs Fixes:
-----------

   Printing of moc objects without pgmu parameters is now working
   properly.

   The expected function was not assigned internally when returnig
   a matrix.

   Entropy now works with 0 posterior probabilities.

   The observed posterior means were not computed correctly when there
   was missing values in the response variable. The values were divided
   by the total weighted posterior propabilities instead of the total
   over non-missing responses. This is fixed in the moc object and in
   the method obsfit.moc.

   There where some problems when plotting the residuals with a big
   number of groups, there is a new option to resolve this (see New
   Features).


New Features:
-------------

   The functions gmu,gshape,gextra,expected are now list of functions:
   one for each group. It should make coding of groups definition easier.
   It uses less memory, so you can run larger models.

   There are new options:

   - the option check.length allows to bypass the dimension check of
     the returned value of the functions in gextra. This allows using
     densities with more parameters.
   - plot.moc now has the option scale which tells to plot the scaled
     variables, prob.legend ta add a mixture probablity legend and
     group.colors to specify the group colors.
   - plot.residuals.moc has the option groups to specify for which
     mixture groups the plot is requested.

   Entropy is now weighted.

   There are some new functions:

   - profilesplot.moc that nicely plot subject profiles with a mix of
     colors.
   - mix.colors.moc computes subjects color by mixing group colors
     according to posterior probabilities. This function is in the file
     Utils.moc.R which is sourced when we load the library. This file
     also contain the functions glogit and inv.glogit.

   The file combine.moc.R contains some utility functions to combine moc
   models and must be sourced by the user to be available.
