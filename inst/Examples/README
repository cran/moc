The examples in this directory uses data sets
available on the Internet and previously analyzed
by various authors so you can validate the results.
The original data sets are now included here, you can

Note however that data on the Internet are often
not original data and have often been manipulated or
cleaned in some undocumented manner. Moreover, sampling
design and procedures are not always available. So don't
draw too many conclusions about the data, these are used
solely for validation and educational purposes.
